/**
 * In node environments, it might be necessary to set up a custom agent to
 * control the network requests being made.
 *
 * To do this, we expose the globalAgentRef variable that can be mutated
 * externally.
 *
 * ðŸš¨ Do not import this file unless you're specifically patching the variable.
 * For read-only access simply import the fetch.ts file. This variable was only
 * isolated into this separate .patch file so that patching code can import this
 * without bringing in transitive dependencies.
 *
 * An example of such a patch where this is critical is in `vscode/src/net/net.patch.ts`
